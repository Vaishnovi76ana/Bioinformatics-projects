# Breast Cancer Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Dataset: 
The folder “Dataset2” contains 2 folders, the “FNA” named folder contains 2 more folders ( ‘benign’ folder contains image datas for 1074 benign cases and ‘malignant’ folder contains image datas for 650 malignant cases)

## Objective: 
A. The folder “test” inside folder “Dataset2” contains unlabelled 14 images. To predict whether the each image depicts benign or malignant tumour.

B. To evaluate the model accuracy and loss function.

## Overview:
1. Preprocessing of given labelled image datas (inside ‘FNA’ files).

2. Training and validating the model (CNN) with the preprocessed images.

3. Estimating and plotting training and validation loss and accuracy function.

4. Fitting the unlabelled images from file ‘test’ to the model and predicting malignant or benign.

## How to run the code:
The packages used in the notebook are random, opencv, numpy, matplotlib , scikit-learn, tensorflow.
The notebook can be run in Google colab after uploading the Dataset2 folder and the .ipynb notebook.
The dataset used are from the Dataset2 folder with FNA and test sub folders.
